# Source priority

Now you can customize the order of all video sources, but it is a bit complex.
Each quality and source now has a priority. 
This means that you can for example make your favorite quality or any videos from your favorite source always appear first.

If the sum of the two priorities is 10 or above the video player will instantly skip loading. For example:
- Video source A: **4**
- Video source B: **1**

- 720p: **6**
- 1080p: **3**

And all sources will be ordered like:

1. Video source A 720p (Priority **10**, instantly skips loading)
2. Videos source A 1080p (Priority **7**)
3. Videos source B 720p (Priority **7**)
4. Videos source B 1080p (Priority **4**)

Your settings can be saved to different profiles to make it easy to sort differently depending on your network connection.
In addition, one profile can be set to default for WiFi and one profile for Mobile data, making it easier to load only the videos your network can
